Will present several inventions inspired by our young kids or... meant to help us with our everyday jobs as dads! Will show:

- ***Lumivelo**, a magic box (Pi, Arduino, RFID) and a network of wifi devices (ESP8266, LED strips) used to synchronise cool lighting setups. Installed on a team of kids bicycle to be highly visible during Montreal night bike tour.
- **Cuscuino**, a “butt detector” cushion (Arduino) to help kids to remain seated during meals.
- **Sabluino**, a digital sandglass (Arduino) to help with morning routine madness
- **Pitune**, a cute music box (Pi, Arduino, RFID) played by swiping real tokens rather than pressing buttons (one song=one token)
- **Balancino**, a 1D led-strip game (Arduino – inspired from line wobbler game) played by balancing on a small wood platform

Intent is to make these devices accessible for everybody to play with during the maker faire!

In 2015, same team presented the “Magic Mirror” intended to help kids with learning reading and writing.

_Tables and Chairs_:
> Exhibits are typically allocated 1 table and 2 chairs (6x6)

- ☐ No tables or chairs needed (my exhibit is mobile)
- ☐ 1 table and 2 chairs
- ☑ **More than 1 table and 2 chairs. List specific number of tables and chairs below**

_Special setup needs_:
> Do you have complicated setup needs that require more than 2 hours to set up? Special requests are not guaranteed by acceptance. You will receive confirmation in advance of the faire.

2 tables and 4 chairs. Facing the centre alley to allow visitors to play with devices installed in front of the tables (one chair, one skateboard-style game etc.)

_Hands-on activity for attendees_:

> Hands-on activities are encouraged at Maker Faire! If not, please reconsider what you could do to engage and inspire attendees.

Devices descibed above will be made available to try. Two will be in the few meters in front of the tables. Might allow visitors to try “Lumivelo” synchronised light effects by wearing standalone wifi-enabled devices. 

_Anything else you would like to tell us?_

In addition to the dads we are encouraging our young kids to be at the booth during the exibit to present and explain the “inventions” with their own words.

==================================

_Project Description_:

Last year we showed the magic-mirror to help kid while learning to read.
This year, we have more than one project to show.
	 
- Lumivélo: A magic-box operated by a 5 year old child change light color on 7 bike at the same time during a night ride.
- Cuscuino: Help kid to stay on chair.
- Sabluino: Help kid/parent to stay on track during the morning race to school/work.
- Special: We plan a Lumivélo retro-fit for the MakerFaire. We will invite attendee to wear a light setup which will be control by a young children. 

_Special setup needs_:

This year, we need two tables and three chair. Since this year we have between 3 and 5 project and we are 3 peoples in charge for the stand. 

Last year we had only one table for our «magic-mirror» project. It was OK but tight.
We spread our material on a 2nd table which allowed us to also present the «Panopi» project.

_Hands-on activity for attendees_:

We plan to retro-fit the «lumivélo» device to fit them on people, so it will be possible for young child to control the light moving around on multiple attendee.
